## 2. Tiny Habits by BJ Fogg - Core Message
2: How can you use B = MAP to make makiQuestion ng new habits easier? What are M, A and P?  
- B = MAP means Behavior = Motivation + Ability + Prompt.  
- M (Motivation): How much you want to do the habit.  
- A (Ability): How easy it is to do the habit.  
- P (Prompt): What triggers you to do the habit.  
- To make habits easier, you can increase ability, reduce friction, and set clear prompts instead of relying only on motivation.  

3: Why is it important to "Shine" or celebrate after each successful completion of habit?  
- Celebrating reinforces the habit by creating a positive emotion.  
- Your brain links success + positive feeling, which strengthens the habit loop.  
- What you celebrate becomes more likely to become automatic over time.  
- This is the most important concept: small wins + celebration = habit formation.
